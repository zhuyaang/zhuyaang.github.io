    <p>
      Welcome to my personal website. I am currently a Master student in <strong>Marketing Management</strong> at 
      <a href="https://www.swufe.edu.cn/">Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE)</a>, China.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My research interests lie in the intersection of <strong>Behavioral Economics</strong> and Marketing. 
      I am particularly interested in how social norms and reciprocity shape consumer decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I am focusing on building my skills in <strong>Python for Data Analysis</strong> and experimental design.
